# Breast-Cancer-ML-Diagnosis: Overview

## Introduction
The Breast-Cancer-ML-Diagnosis repository contains a machine learning-powered app designed to assist medical professionals in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The app utilizes a set of measurements to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant and provides a radar chart for visual representation of the input data. It also displays the predicted diagnosis along with the probability of the mass being benign or malignant.

## Features

### Data Input
- **Manual Entry**: Users have the option to manually input measurements related to the breast mass.
- **Lab Connection**: The app is designed for potential integration with cytology labs to automate data input directly from lab machines. (Note: The actual lab connection is not part of the app itself.)

### Data Visualization
- **Radar Chart**: The app employs a radar chart to visually represent the input measurements, offering a quick and intuitive understanding of the data.

### Prediction and Probability
- **Diagnosis Prediction**: Based on the input data, the app predicts whether the breast mass is benign or malignant.
- **Probability Display**: Alongside the diagnosis, the app also displays the probability of the mass being benign or malignant.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: The predictive model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.
- **Visualization Tools**: Radar charts are used for data visualization.

## Disclaimer
This app is developed as a machine learning exercise using the public dataset Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It is intended solely for educational purposes in the field of machine learning and is not designed for professional medical use. The dataset may not be entirely reliable for clinical diagnosis.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Addition of other visualization tools for better data interpretation.
- Enabling real-time data input from cytology labs.

## Conclusion
The Breast-Cancer-ML-Diagnosis app serves as a practical example of the potential applications of machine learning in healthcare, specifically in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. While not intended for professional use, the app offers valuable insights into machine learning's capabilities in medical diagnostics.
